# TODO

## Learn MyST

Go through its tutorial and practice its features. Then try moving a page of the nla/689
documentation to MyST/Sphinx, even if the layout is not yet what I want.

## Learn PyData Sphinx Theme

From its website. Then adjust the theme so that the article content width can be increased.

## Learn sphinx-design Extension

From its documentation. Play around with with it offers to get familiar with its
widgets. 

## Plan

For the landing page using sphinx-design cards. For each case file use a separate card.
Look at other PyData websites for inspiration in designing my site.
